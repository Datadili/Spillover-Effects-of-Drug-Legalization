   \noindent In this paper, I use the difference-in-difference estimator to determine the causal effects of bordering a state that has legalized either medical or recreational marijuana. I look at three different outcomes: possession of marijuana, hard drugs, and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The outcomes are proxies for marijuana use, hard drug use, and substitution possibilities between alcohol and marijuana. Using a novel dataset and the FBI's UCR panel data from 1990â€“2020, I find that within non-legal states, counties that border legal states had about 22 additional hard drug possession cases. I found no evidence of an increase in marijuana consumption or a decrease in alcohol consumption.

# Introduction {#sec1}

In 1996, California made history as the first state to legalize medical
marijuana. By 2012, Colorado and Washington State led the way in
recreational marijuana legalization. As of 2023, 38 states and D.C. have
adopted medical marijuana laws (MMLs), and 21 states plus D.C. have
enacted recreational marijuana laws (RMLs). Advocates for further
legalization say it has the potential to mitigate racial disparities in
arrests, particularly given that minorities are disproportionately
affected by marijuana-related arrests [@edwards-2020]. Some also argue
that the legalization could induce individuals using substances like
alcohol to shift their preference towards marijuana [@bachhuber-2014;
@powell-2018].

The ongoing discourse on legalization also faces staunch opposition,
with the opposing side highlighting the potential dangers to society.
Critics argue that legalization may serve as an incentive for non-users
to turn to marijuana due to increased accessibility [@groce-2018]. A
major concern is also that marijuana's addictive nature could
potentially pave the way for the consumption of harder drugs like
cocaine, meth, and heroin. Critics additionally express concerns about
the spillover effect of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) or recreational
marijuana laws (RMLs) into jurisdictions without such laws, potentially
exporting some of the associated consequences across borders. For the
sake of brevity, I use the term "states with any marijuana law" (AML), "legalized states," or
"states with AMLs" to collectively refer to states that have adopted
either RMLs or MMLs.

In this study, I investigate the impact of bordering a state with any
marijuana law (AML) after the adoption of AML in that state in order to
comprehensively address concerns and assertions from both sides. I look
at various outcomes, including direct crimes such as marijuana
possession as well as indirect or "consequential" crimes like possession
of hard drugs and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The
reason being that people in counties that border AML states could easily
have access to marijuana by crossing their state border, so they should
experience similar effects as though they were in the AML state.
Leveraging a novel county-level dataset from 1990 to 2020 from different
sources, including the Uniform Crime Reports and the US Census Bureau, I
implement a robust difference-in-differences identification strategy.
This method carefully controls for county-linear time trends, with
standard errors clustered at the county level, thereby mitigating
concerns related to county-level confounding. From the standpoint of the
supporters, one would anticipate a decline in DUIs due to the suggested
"shift" from alcohol to marijuana. Conversely, from the perspective of
opponents, an increase in marijuana possession crimes (used as a proxy
for marijuana use) and hard drug crimes (used as a proxy for hard drug
use) might be expected.

Ultimately, I find that counties bordering states with any marijuana law
experienced an increase of approximately 22 possession of hard drugs
arrests following the enactment of either of the marijuana laws. I found
no conclusive evidence suggesting that bordering a state that has
legalized any marijuana law (AML) had any significant impact on
marijuana crimes (indicative of marijuana use) or DUIs (shifting from
alcohol to marijuana). This research contributes to the growing
literature on the spillover effects of recreational and medical drug
legalization. To my knowledge, this is the first study to
comprehensively examine the bordering counties of all states that have
not legalized any type of marijuana law to investigate potential
spillovers. Most studies usually focus on a subset of states at the
time.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 1.1 summarizes the
existing literature on the effects of both medical and recreational
marijuana legalization. Section 2 describes the data sources, how the
data was constructed, and the variables used in the study. Section 3
shows the identification strategy used and the results found, while
Section 4 presents the possible extensions of this study, further
limitations, and concluding remarks.

## Marijuana Laws, Marijuana and Hard Drug Use, and DUIs {#sec11}

Earlier studies have generally found no link between marijuana use and
MMLs. State variation in marijuana use was usually attributed to
state-specific usage before any law was passed [@cerda-2012]. More
recent studies that account for state and time differences reach
conflicting conclusions, with some citing no effect
[@lynne-landsman-2013], while others find increases [@kelly-2014], and
decreases [@harper-2012]. There are fewer studies that assess the effect
of RMLs on marijuana use, simply because the adoption of RMLs came
relatively sometime after the adoption of MMLs. Studies have found that
states with RMLs tend to prescribe fewer opioid medications [@wen-2018]
and have fewer deaths involving opioid prescriptions [@shover-2019].
Numerous studies do indeed emphasize the correlation between
recreational drug legalization and increased usage of harder substances
[@olfson-2018; @wong-2019; @bleyer-2018].

As for the effects on DUIs, literature has largely found a negative
association between medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and DUIs
[@anderson-2013; @santaella-tenorio-2017], though some studies report a
significant increase in driving under the influence of marijuana in MML
states [see @fink-2020]. There is conflicting literature regarding the
effects of recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) on dui cases. For example,
@lane-2019 showed that recreational cannabis sales in Colorado and
Washington were associated with an increase and then a decrease in
traffic fatalities involving alcohol, yet @santaella-tenorio-2017
reported only a slight increase in traffic fatalities in Colorado, with
Washington showing no effect at all. The handful of studies that
explored the impact of RMLs on alcohol use mostly found that enacting an
RML led to a decrease in binge drinking and a decline in alcohol sales
[@dragone-2019; @miller-2021].

While there is an array of medical studies that examine and consequently
find substitution possibilities between alcohol and marijuana use [see
@lucas-2020], very few studies examine the switch from alcohol to
marijuana as a result of when legalization policies occur. Former
alcohol users who use marijuana as a result of policy changes differ
from those who would have substituted to marijuana usage regardless of
any policy change. Thus, inferences cannot be drawn from studies that do
not take policy legalization into account. Studies that look at
substitution policies within the context of policy enactment find
conflicting results [see @pacula-2022].

Relatively few studies analyze the effect of legalization on neighboring
states. Most studies look at the spillover effects of other
region-specific policies on surrounding areas, like gun laws
[@knight-2013]; minimum drinking age laws [@figlio-1995]; and cigarette
pricing laws [@lovenheim-2008]. The paper most similar to mine is by
@hao-2017, which examined the spillover effects of recreational
marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington on neighboring states
using a difference-in-differences estimator. They found an increase in
marijuana possession arrests and marijuana usage in counties that border
states that have legalized marijuana. They found no impact on DUI or
hard drug arrests.

# Data

In order to capture where and when border counties were "exposed" to
recreational or medical marijuana laws from their adjacent counties, I
constructed a novel dataset using data from the US Census Bureau, public
records, and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). The initial step
involved obtaining data on counties that share borders in all 50 states
from the US Census Bureau. Subsequently, I refined this dataset to
include only counties that share borders with counties in different
states. Within this subset, I further identified border counties located
next to states that had legalized medical or recreational marijuana. I manually collected data on legalized states and the respective
years these laws were enacted, using information available in public
records. All non-legal states share a border with a state that has
legalized some form of marijuana law. @fig-1_border_map visualizes this.
This study exclusively focuses on states where marijuana is not
currently legalized. Furthermore, any state that legalized marijuana
after the year 2020 is still categorized as non-legalized within the
scope of this study.

![Treated, Control, and Excluded
Counties](images/summary_treated_graph.png){#fig-1_border_map
fig-align="center" width="89%"}

I then collected data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which tracks the number of different crimes in each state and county from 1974 to 2020. Specifically, I used the total number of arrests for marijuana possession, hard drug possession, and driving under the influence from 1990 to 2020. My first dependent variable of interest is "direct" crimes, like the possession of marijuana cases, which is a proxy for marijuana use. With legalization comes increased access to marijuana, so one can expect possession of marijuana crimes to go down within the state that legalized it^[Even in states where marijuana is legalized, individuals can face arrest for possession or sale. In recreational states, selling without a license is prohibited, and in medical states, possessing marijuana without a doctor's prescription is illegal.]. I, on the other hand, look at this variable to determine if the increased access or "use" made its way into counties that have not legalized it. If it did, then one can expect marijuana possession cases to go up within those counties.

My second and third variables of interest are "indirect" crimes, which
include hard drug possession, which is a proxy for drug use, and driving
under the influence (DUI), which is a proxy for switching to marijuana
from alcohol. The rationale here is that with more potential access to
marijuana from border counties, a subsequent demand for more addictive
drugs (like hard drugs) should follow, thus increasing the possession of
hard drug crimes (opposing view). Despite the potential for an
alternative scenario, where legalization of marijuana would result in
substituting away from illegal hard drugs towards marijuana, the
hypothesis of this study leans towards the former perspective. The
objective is to examine whether the claims of those opposing further
legalization hold true. I use the indirect crime of DUIs to test the
claims of those in favor of further legalization. If substitution
effects exist between alcohol and marijuana, bordering counties, with
easier access to marijuana, should experience fewer DUI cases as
individuals would consume more marijuana in place of alcohol.

My independent variable of interest is a dummy variable takes a value of
1 if a county within a non-legalized state shares a border with a state
that has legalized either medical or recreational marijuana. If the
county in a non-legalized state does not border a legalized state, the
dummy variable takes a value of 0. A border county can be under the
control group if it does not border a legalized state. If a county borders
multiple legalized states, only the state that legalized marijuana
earliest is considered. Counties bordering both legalized and non-legalized states are included in the treatment group. For states that have legalized
both medical and recreational marijuana, the year selected for the
analysis is based on the larger of the two years. For example, if a
state adopted medical marijuana laws (MMLs) in 2012 and recreational
marijuana laws (RMLs) in 2019, the selected year for analysis is 2019.
This is done to capture more of the recreational legalization effect,
since RMLs are adopted in the years following an MML adoption.^[All states that have legalized recreational adopted medical first] The
reasoning for this is that states with RMLs generally provide greater
access to marijuana compared to states with MMLs, where a doctor's
prescription is required.

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics. On average, control counties have 262 arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol arrests, which is significantly higher than treated counties, which had 167 arrests. Interestingly, control counties also had higher possession of marijuana cases, at an average of 125 cases per year, in comparison to treated counties, at 119 per year. Hard drug possession arrests were higher on average in treated counties (120) than in non-treated counties (90). The treatment group comprises 1,301 counties located within states that have not legalized marijuana but are adjacent to a state where either medical or recreational marijuana is legal. Meanwhile, the control group consists of 35,682 counties, which are also in non-legalized states.

# Empirical Analysis and Results {#sec2}

## Identification Strategy {#sec3}

To distinguish the effect of marijuana legalization from confounding
factors, I exploit the within-state variation induced by the fact that
38 states enacted MMLs between 1990 and 2020 and 21 enacted RMLs passed
the law during that same time period. More specifically, I used a
difference-in-differences research design to ask whether outcomes change
more in counties that border legalized states than in counties that do not. My
main specification is summarized in the following regression equation:

$$Y^j_{it} = \delta\mathbbm{1}{(Border_{i} * AML_{t})} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \lambda_i * t + \epsilon_{it}$$ {#eq-1}

<!-- $$Y^j_{it} = \delta\mathbbm{1}{(Border * AML)}_{it} + \gamma_i + \alpha_t + \beta_i * t + \epsilon_{it}$$ {#eq-1} -->
where $j$ represents a set of outcomes, including the number of cases of
marijuana possession, possession of hard drugs, and driving under the
influence of alcohol. $Y^j_{it}$ is the outcome $j$ for county
$i$ in year $t$. $\alpha_i$ captures county fixed effects, while
$\gamma_t$ captures year-fixed effects. $\lambda_i * t$ flexibility
controls for county-specific linear time trends whereas $\epsilon_{it}$ is a stochastic error term. The $\mathbbm{1}{(Border_{i} * AML_{t})}$ term is an indicator
that is equal to 1 when county $i$ borders a state that adopted
any marijuana law (AML) in year $t$. It takes the value of 0 otherwise, and $\delta$ is our
variable of interest. If the pre-trends assumption holds, then
$\delta$ captures the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of
bordering a state with AML. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

## Event Study Design

To ensure that @eq-1 effectively captures the average treatment effect
on the treated (ATT), the parallel trends assumption must hold. This
assumption suggests that, counties that border other counties which
never adopt AML are on the same trend in terms of their DUIs, marijuana
offenses, and hard drug offenses, as counties that border other counties
which did adopt AML. In essence, this assumption requires that the
outcomes in these two groups of counties were comparable before the
neighboring state implemented AML. However, it is plausible that even
after accounting for county-by-year fixed effects in @eq-1, treated
counties may have followed a distinct outcome trajectory compared to the
non-treated counties before the bordering state adopted AML. I test this
by examining whether trajectories prior to the AML adoption were
parallel. To do this, I use the following event-study model:

$$Y^j_{it} = \sum^{k = 5}_{k=-5; k \neq -1}\theta_k\mathbbm{1}{(Border_{i} * AML_{t+k})} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \lambda_i * t + \epsilon_{it}$$ {#eq-event}


In this model, $\mathbbm{1}{(Border_{i} * AML_{t+k})}$ is a series of lags and leads for the years before
and after a border state adopts AML. Periods before the legalization are
the pre-trends, with the parameters of interest being $\theta_k$ for
$k < 0$. If the estimates on those parameters are close to zero, this
suggests trajectories in counties that border an AML state were similar
to untreated counties prior to when the AML was adopted.

## Results {#sec-rec}

Table 2 shows the results of a difference-in-differences estimate of
@eq-1. Columns 1 and 2 look at the direct effect, which is marijuana
possession. Column (1) reports a negative coefficient, but when I allow
for counties to follow their own trends, as in Column (2), the
coefficient becomes positive. This suggests that controlling for county
time trends mitigates some omitted variables. Ultimately, I find no
evidence of an effect on the possession of marijuana. Columns 3--6 look
at the indirect effects, which are possession of hard drugs and driving
under the influence arrests. Column (4) shows that when controlling for
country-time trends, on average, counties that border AML states had 22
additional possession of hard drug cases. This result is statistically
significant at the 0.1 level. Columns 5--6 report positive coefficients
with DUI as the dependent variable, though they are not statistically
insignificant, and thus I cannot make valid inferences.

```{=latex}

\textbf{Table 2}: The Direct and Indirect Effects of Bordering an AML State\\
\end{center}
\input{~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/WRITING SAMPLE/border_treated/Paper/ident.tex}
\end{table}
```
@fig-weed, @fig-hard, and @fig-dui visualize @eq-event for our outcomes
of interest. The leads in all our models were not statistically
different from 0, which means that there's no evidence that trends in
direct or indirect outcomes were different between treated and untreated
counties before the bordering state enacted any marijuana law. During
the treatment year, there was a statistically significant increase in
the possession of marijuana crimes. This may be due to the fact that
people in counties that border AML states could easily have access to
marijuana by crossing their state border, but the effect is short-lived.
Similarly, for hard drug possession crimes, @eq-event estimates a jump
on the treatment year and no statistically significant differences in
the years after. There is a statistically significant decrease in DUI
cases for border counties in the year after it was treated, which falls
in line with the theory that people substitute marijuana for alcohol,
which consequently leads to a decrease in DUIs. Again, this effect seems
to be temporary.

# Conclusion

In this study, I investigated the impact of bordering a state that has
legalized recreational or medical marijuana within states that did not
adopt any form of marijuana law (AML). Within non-legalized states, I
used counties that directly border AML states as my treatment group and
counties that do not border a state with AML as my control group. Using
a difference-in-differences design, I found that counties that border
AML states had an increase in the total number of hard drug crimes by 22
cases. I found no evidence of an effect on possession of marijuana or
DUI cases.

To my knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the effect of both
recreational and medical marijuana within a state on the counties
closest to them using within-state variation of when the laws were
passed. Furthermore, the existing literature is prone to bias from
confounding trends at the county level. In my approach, I use
county-by-year fixed effects to flexibly control for unobserved
time-varying effects that differ by county to eliminate bias. This study
also uses all non-legalized states and spans a longer period of time
than past studies.

There are, however, limits to my study design. First, the outcome data
lists arrests by county and not individual; thus, there is the
possibility of repeat offenders and double counting, which could lead to
overestimated results. I do not include control variables because of a
lack of data availability, but it's possible that controlling for
population or other covariates could decrease or increase my magnitude.
This paper also ignores the fact that police in counties that border
legalized states may be more or less active in making marijuana-related
arrests after the law is passed because they anticipate a higher level
of marijuana in circulation. Thus, I recommend future studies account
for this by including additional controls. Further analysis may also
look at various forms of treatment, i.e., non-AML counties that border
only recreational states or counties within states that have legalized
medical marijuana that border states that have legalized recreational
marijuana.

Economists frequently have used
policy-based natural experiments to estimate the casual effect on DUI
arrests ()


I used three primary sources of data. First, I used data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) that document the rates of different crimes by state and county, age and gender from the year 1990 to 2020. Specifically, I use robbery, burglary, possession and sale of cocaine and the total number of drug arrests. I use these data to determine whether legalizing marijuana deters or increases drug crimes, or crimes that may be affected by their legalization (cite SOURCE). The first is robbery, which the FBI defines as "the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear" (cite FBI h). The second is burglary, defined as "The unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft." Lastly, total drug arrests, which encompasses everything involving Opium or cocaine and their derivatives (morphine, heroin, codeine), marijuana, synthetic narcotics---manufactured narcotics which can cause true drug addiction (demerol, methadones) and dangerous nonnarcotic drugs (barbiturates, benzedrine) 


Second, I individually collected data on whether each state legalized recreational or marijuana, as well as the year it was legalized.



OLD###


In 1996, California became the first state to legalize medical
marijuana. In 2012, Colorado and Washington State became the first to
legalize marijuana at the recreational level. As of 2023, 38 states and
D.C. have enacted medical marijuana laws (MMLs), while 21 states plus
D.C. have enacted recreational marijuana laws (RMLs). Those in support
of the expansion argue that increased legalization could reduce racial
disparities in arrests, as minorities are more likely to get arrested
for marijuana (Edwards and Mandubuonwu 2020). Some claim that
legalization could lead users of substances such as alcohol to
substitute for marijuana (Bachhuber et al. 2014; Powell et al. 2018). 

The ongoing legalization debate also has a strong opposing side,
however, with those opposed to the ruling citing how legalization could prompt non-users to turn to marijuana because of easier access \citep{Groce_2018}. Another major concern is how the additive nature of marijuana could potentially lead to consumption of hard drugs like cocaine, meth, and heroin. Many studies do indeed show the relationship between drug legalization and hard drug use (Olfsin et al. 2019; Wong and Lin 2019; Bleyer and Barnes 2018). Critics further express concern that MMLs or RMLs could spillover into jurisdictions that do not have either law enacted, thus bringing some of the consequences across borders. For ease of notation, I refer to states that have legalized either RMLs or MMLs as states with any marijuana law (AML) or states with AMLs.

To address both concerns and claims from either side, in this study, I examine the effect of bordering an AML state on the subsequent years after said state
adopted AML. I specifically look at outcomes such as direct crimes (like
possession of marijuana) and indirect or "consequential" crimes like
possession of hard drugs and driving under the influence (DUI). I use a novel county-level dataset from 1990--2020 from a variety of sources (the
Uniform Crime Reports, US Census Bureau, and the National Bureau of
Economic Research), as well as a difference-in-differences
identification strategy. My approach controls for county-by-year fixed
effects and clusters by the county level, so as to overcome concerns related to county-level confounding. Based on the point of view of the supporters, one should expect DUIs to go down because of the proposed "switch" from alcohol to marijuana. From the opposing view, there should be an increase in marijuana possession crimes (used as a proxy for marijuana use) and hard drug crimes (used as a proxy for hard drug use). 

Ultimately, I find that counties bordering AML states experienced a
decrease in the number of hard drug crimes in the subsequent years after
legalization, in comparison to other counties within the same state. I
found no effect on marijuana crimes (marijuana use) or DUIs (switching from alchol to marijuana). This research contributes to the growing economics literature on the spillover effects of recreational drug
legalization, particularly on crimes involving addictions. To my
knowledge, this is the first study to also look at all states that
border AML states to determine possible spillover effects, most studies only look at two bordering states at a time. 

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1.1 summarizes the
existing literature of effects of both medical and recreational
marijuana legalization. Section 2 describes the data sources, how the
data was constructed, and variables used in the study. Section 3 shows
the identification strategy used and the results found, while section 4
presents the possible extensions of this study, further limitations,
possible policy effects, and concluding remarks.

## Marijuana Laws, Marijuana and Hard Drug Use, and DUIs
Earlier studies have generally found no link between marijuana use and MMLs. State variation in marijuana use was usually attributed to state-specific usage before any law was passed (Wall, et al., 2011). More recent studies that account for state and time differences reach conflicting conclusions, with some citing no effect (Harper, et al., 2012; Lynne-Landsman, et al., 2013), while others find increases (Kelly and Rasul, 2014), and decreases (Harper, Strumpf, and Kaufman, 2012). There are fewer studies that assess the effect of RMLs on marijuna use, simply because the adoption of RMLs came relatively sometime after the adoption of MMLs. Studies have found that states with RMLs tend to prescribe fewer opioid medications (Wen and Hockenberry 2018) and have fewer deaths involving opiod prescriptions (Stover et al. 2019).

As for the effects on DUIs, literature has largely found a negative association between medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and DUIs (Anderson et al. (2013), Santaella-Tenorio et al. (2017)), though some studies report a significant increase in driving under the influence of marijuana in MML states (Fink et al. 2020). There is conflicting literature regarding the effects of recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) on dui cases. For example, Lane and Hall (2019) showed that recreational cannabis sales in Colorado and Washington were associated with an increase and then a decrease in traffic fatalities involving alcohol, yet Santaella-Tenorio et al. (2020) report only a slight increase in traffic fatalities in Colorado, with Washington showing no effect at all. The handful of studies that explored the impact of RMLs on alcohol use mostly found that enacting an RML led to a decrease in binge drinking and a decline in alcohol sales (Dragone et al. (2019), Miller and Seo (2020)).

While there is an array of medical studies that examine and consequently find substitution possibilities between alcohol and marijuana use (see Philippe Lucas, 2020), very few studies examine the switch from alcohol to marijuana as a result of when legalization policies occur. Former alcohol users who use marijuana as a result of policy changes differ from those who would have substituted to marijuana usage regardless of any policy change. Thus, inferences cannot be drawn from studies that do not take policy legalization into account. Studies that look at substitution policies within the context of policy enactment find conflicting results (see Rosalie Liccardo Pacula et al., 2022).

Relatively few studies analyze the effect of legalization on neighboring states. Most studies look at the spillover effects of other region-specific policies on surrounding areas, like gun laws (Knight 2013); minimum drinking age laws (Figlio 1995); and cigarette pricing laws (Lovenheim 2008). The paper most similar to mine is by Zhuang Hao and Benjamin Cowan (2017), which examined the spillover effects of recreational marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington on neighboring states using a difference-in-differences estimator. They found an increase in marijuana possession arrests and marijuana usage in border counties of neighboring states in comparison to non-border counties with the same states. They found no impact on DUI or hard drug arrests.


For Equation  to capture the ATT, the parallel trends assumption that non-AML counties that border AML states had comparable marijuana use, hard drug use and DUIs as non-AML counties in the same state  the bordering state adopted 
AML must hold. It is possible that, even when controlling for county, year and county-by-year fixed effects, that non-AML counties that border AML states were following a different outcome
trajectory than non-AML counties. I test this by examining whether trajectories before 
the AML adoption were parallel. To do this, I use the following event-study model:


To address both concerns and claims from either side, in this study, I
examine the effect of bordering an AML state on the subsequent years
after said state adopted AML. I specifically look at outcomes such as
direct crimes (like possession of marijuana) and indirect or
"consequential" crimes like possession of hard drugs and driving under
the influence (DUI). I use a novel county-level dataset from 1990--2020
from a variety of sources (the Uniform Crime Reports, US Census Bureau,
and the National Bureau of Economic Research), as well as a
difference-in-differences identification strategy. My approach controls
for county-by-year fixed effects and clusters by the county level, so as
to overcome concerns related to county-level confounding. Based on the
point of view of the supporters, one should expect DUIs to go down
because of the proposed "switch" from alcohol to marijuana. From the
opposing view, there should be an increase in marijuana possession
crimes (used as a proxy for marijuana use) and hard drug crimes (used as
a proxy for hard drug use).

trajectories in counties that border an AML state to untreated counties were similar prior to when the AML was adopted.


Next, I used data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) that
document the number of different crimes by state and county from the year 1974 to 2020. Specifically, I use the total number of possession of marijuana arrests, hard drug arrests and driving under
the influence arrests. I use these data to determine whether legalizing
marijuana deters or increases subsequent drug crimes, or crimes that may
be affected by their legalization.

The dependent variables are "direct" crimes such as the number of
arrests per possession of marijuana and "indirect crimes" such
as possession of hard drug arrests, and driving under the influence. Throughout the analysis, the focus is on adults and my sample is restricted to the year 1990 to 2020.
